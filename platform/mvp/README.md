# Velocity Quantal — platform/mvp

This skeleton contains minimal files to run a platform MVP demonstrating RAG ingestion, evidence submission, and stakeholder portals.

Structure
- /wireframes — markdown wireframes for stakeholder pages
- /src — placeholder for frontend and functions (not included in this skeleton)

How to use
1. Review the wireframes in `wireframes/`.
2. Scaffold a React + Vite frontend and serverless functions in `src/` when ready.

Notes
- This repo is intentionally minimal to keep CapEx low. Use managed services and provider trial credits for the pilot.
