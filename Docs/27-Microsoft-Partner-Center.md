## Purpose

Quick reference for the key menus, programs, and actions in Microsoft Partner Center relevant to small partners and ISVs. Use this page to map partner benefits to tasks (skilling, deployments, marketplace, co-sell) and to prepare evidence for partner-score submissions.

## High-level navigation (items provided)

- Home / Membership / Overview
- Microsoft Action Pack
- Legacy Silver/Gold
- Launch Benefits
- Success Core Benefits / Success Expanded Benefits

- ISV Success Program: Build & Publish, Marketplace Rewards
- Surface Reseller Alliance (see `Docs/26-Surface-Reseller-Alliance.md`)
- Azure Expert MSP / Training Services Partner
- Solutions Partner (Overview + designations)
  - Business Applications
  - Data & AI
  - Digital & App Innovation
  - Infrastructure
  - Modern Work
  - Security
- Insights / Specializations (Azure, Modern Work, Security, Business Applications)

## What each area means (concise)

- Microsoft Action Pack: low-cost access to software & dev/test licenses for SMBs and solution building.
- Legacy Silver/Gold: older competency model (informational) — focus on current Solutions Partner designations.
- Success Core / Success Expanded: benefit tiers tied to partner performance and incentives.
- ISV Success Program: guidance and rewards for independent software vendors to package, list, and monetize apps on Microsoft marketplaces.
- Surface Reseller Alliance: reseller-specific program and incentives for Surface device bundles (see doc).
- Azure Expert MSP / Training Services: accreditation routes for managed services and training providers.
- Solutions Partner (track designations): program that maps partner capabilities to six solution areas — drives incentives and co-sell eligibility.
- Specializations: deeper technical proofs (e.g., Azure, Modern Work) that provide differentiated recognition.

## Key actions to improve partner score (mapped to portal items)

- Skilling: enroll and complete required intermediate/advanced certifications; assign named personnel and record cert IDs in the portal.
- Net Customer Adds: prioritize 3–5 quick-win customer engagements per track and record order/invoice evidence.
- Deployments / DPOR/CPOR/CSP: capture deployments with tenant IDs, dates, and customer attestations; produce 1-page case studies.
- Marketplace: package 1–2 productized offers (ISV templates, micro-SaaS) and publish to Azure/GCP marketplaces as applicable.
- Co-sell & GTM: register co-sell opportunities, run joint marketing (webinars, demos), and collect lead metrics.

## Suggested immediate checklist

- [ ] Review Partner Center → Insights → Program Requirements for each Solutions Partner track.
- [ ] Identify 3 target customers and run scoped pilots for Business Applications, Data & AI, and Modern Work.
- [ ] Assign skilling targets and enroll staff into required certs this quarter.
- [ ] Prepare evidence pack template (deployment summary, screenshots, invoice, customer contact).
- [ ] Publish 1 marketplace item (ISV) or list a prebuilt Power Platform solution.

## Owner & Next Steps

- Owner: `@mdresch` — keep this page current and link partner-evidence artifacts here.
- Next step: would you like a) an evidence template file under `Docs/` for partner submissions, b) three scaffolded case-study drafts, or c) an automated checklist for tracking certs/deployments? Pick one and I'll create it.
