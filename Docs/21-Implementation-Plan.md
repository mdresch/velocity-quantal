## Overview

This Implementation Plan outlines key components and a step-by-step approach for running pilot experiments and moving successful pilots to scale.

## Key Components

- Opportunity intake and triage process.
- Pilot definition template (objectives, success metrics, timeline, owner).
- Execution support (mentors, tooling, data collection).
- Review and decision process for reinvestment or scale.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Intake: capture opportunity using the feasibility template.
2. Triage: score by value, feasibility, and risk; shortlist top candidates.
3. Pilot design: define plan, owner, KPIs, tools and timeline.
4. Execute pilot: run experiment, collect metrics, hold retrospectives.
5. Decide: based on metrics and sponsor input, archive, iterate, or scale.
