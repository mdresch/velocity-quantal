## Summary

Procurement activity should be minimal during pilots; prefer free-tier tools and short-term contracts. Any vendor contracting requires sponsor approval.

## Procurement Guidelines

- Approve purchases above $500 with sponsor sign-off.
- Use lightweight vendor evaluation for pilot-stage tools.
