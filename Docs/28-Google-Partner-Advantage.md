## Purpose

Reference guide for the Google Cloud Partner Advantage program: partnership paths, learning and certification, benefits, partner tools, and practical next steps for small partners and ISVs.

## Partner Advantage — At a glance

- Program guide: Partner Advantage Program Guide (primary reference).
- Partner Advantage overview video and slides (recommended primer).
- Core themes: learn, grow your business, deliver high-quality outcomes for customers.

## Ways to partner

- Sell: reseller paths, indirect reseller via distributors, sell activation journey (Member → Partner → Premier).
- Service: consulting, managed services, professional services delivery across product families.
- Build: ISV route—build, validate, and list solutions; earn Google Cloud Ready recognition.

Key notes:
- Getting started as an indirect reseller: partner with a distributor to accelerate market access.
- Resell with a distributor: benefits include faster GTM and operational support.

## Products & Solutions

- Products: core Google Cloud products to build on (Compute, Storage, BigQuery, Vertex AI, Firebase, Workspace).
- Solutions: focus on packageable solutions that modernize customer workloads (analytics, AI, cloud migration, workspace productivity).

## Credentials & Certifications

- Partner learning paths and credentials overview — map required certs to partner benefits.
- Partner Learning Center and technical training FAQs provide guidance on earning credentials.
- Prioritize role-based certs that align to your chosen track (e.g., Data & AI, Infrastructure, Workspace).

## Benefits

- Incentives, sales & marketing resources, technical enablement, and GTM support.
- Partner internal use discounts (Workspace), sandbox access (VMware Engine), and marketplace opportunities.

## Partner Tools & Account

- Cloud Identity and account management guidance.
- Partner templates: business plan sheet, GTM templates, readiness checklists.

## Google Cloud Ready & Marketplace

- Google Cloud Ready: earn recognition for validated solutions.
- Marketplace: package and publish solutions to reach customers and earn rewards.

## Suggested immediate actions

1. Watch the Partner Advantage overview video and review the Program Guide.
2. Choose a primary path (Sell / Service / Build) and map 3 quick pilots or marketplace items.
3. Assign skilling targets and enroll staff in required certifications; track cert IDs.
4. Prepare a business plan template and a marketplace listing checklist for ISV offers.
5. Capture deployment evidence and customer attestations for partner-score submissions.

## Templates & Next Steps

- Recommended: create an evidence template, three case-study drafts, and a marketplace readiness checklist (I can scaffold these under `Docs/`).

## Owner

- Document owner: `@mdresch` — maintain links to training resources, marketplace artifacts, and partner evidence.
