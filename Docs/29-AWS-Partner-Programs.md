Key facts:
- AWS partners commonly generate significant services revenue relative to AWS technology sales.
- Marketplace integration and AI adoption are common accelerators for partners.

## Suggested immediate actions

1. Select the primary business model (Resell / Service / Build) and map three quick pilots or offers.
2. Explore AWS Marketplace listing for any productized solutions or micro-SaaS offerings.
3. Join relevant APN programs (MSP, ISV Accelerate, Well-Architected) that match your GTM and technical capabilities.
4. Run a cost-optimization or migration sprint for one customer to produce deployment evidence and usage growth.
5. Use APN resources (workshops, blogs, webinars) to map incentives and evidence requirements for partner scorecards.

## Owner & Next Steps
