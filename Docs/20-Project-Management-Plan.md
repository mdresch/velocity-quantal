## Purpose

The Project Management Plan (PMP) consolidates subsidiary plans and defines how the program will be planned, executed, monitored and closed. It references scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, resource, communications, procurement and integration plans.

## Structure

- Scope Management: see `06-Scope-Schedule-Cost.md`.
- Schedule Management: see `14-Schedule-Management-Plan.md`.
- Cost Management: see `13-Cost-Management-Plan.md`.
- Quality Management: see `12-Quality-Management-Plan.md`.
- Risk Management: see `09-Risk-Register.md`.
- Resource & Procurement: see `15-Resource-Management-Plan.md` and `16-Procurement-Management-Plan.md`.

## Governance

- Steering Committee: executive sponsor(s) and PM for major decisions.
- Change Control Board (CCB): sponsors, PM, finance/legal for substantive changes.

## Monitoring & Control

- Regular status cadence: weekly team syncs, bi-weekly sponsor updates, end-of-pilot retrospectives.
- Use dashboard metrics and pilot KPIs for decision-making.
