## Overview

This artifact describes the Surface Reseller Alliance membership, current tier status, progress toward higher incentive levels, available benefits, and tier eligibility criteria. Use this page to track actions required to increase tier, collect evidence, and prepare submissions to the partner portal.

## Tier Status & Progress

- Current Tier: **Bronze / Registered** (example — replace with actual tier)
- Progress to next tier: X% (points or metrics tracked in partner portal)
- Next Tier Target: **Silver** — required thresholds: net customer adds, deployments, revenue, skilling, and partner-led marketing activity.

Key metrics to track (examples — map to partner portal fields):
- Net Customer Adds (count)
- Qualified Deployments (count)
- Revenue or deal value (EUR/USD)
- Skilling: intermediate/advanced certifications (count)
- Joint marketing / co-sell activities (events, referrals)

## Tier Benefits (typical)

- Access to partner incentives and rebates.
- Co-sell and marketplace opportunities.
- Technical presales and deployment support credits.
- Partner marketing resources and prioritized leads.
- Early access to product previews and partner-only trainings.

## Eligibility Criteria (summary)

- Demonstrated customer engagements and net-new customer adds within the program period.
- Minimum number of paid or validated deployments (DPOR/CSP/CPOR equivalents per region).
- Designated skilling and certification thresholds for named reseller personnel.
- Evidence of active partner-led usage growth or adoption metrics.
- Compliance with licensing and program terms (CSP enrollment, reseller agreements).

## Practical Actions to Improve Tier Score

1. Identify 3–5 target customers for quick Surface-led or Surface-enabled deployments (device + service bundles).
2. Run short paid pilots and capture deployment artifacts: order numbers, provisioning screenshots, customer contact/email, deployment date.
3. Enroll named staff in required Microsoft certifications and record completion in the partner portal.
4. Execute a joint marketing activity (webinar, local event, demo day) and record registrations/leads.
5. Compile 1-page case studies and customer attestations summarizing outcomes and metrics.

## Evidence & Submission Checklist

- Deployment evidence: provisioning/order IDs, tenant IDs, screenshots, customer contact.
- Financial proof: invoices, purchase orders, or transaction receipts (redact sensitive data).
- Skilling proof: certification IDs and linked profiles.
- Marketing proof: event agenda, attendee list, recording link, campaign metrics.
- Case study: customer name (with permission), summary, outcomes, metric snapshot.

## Owner & Next Steps

- Document owner: `@mdresch` — maintain current tier status and upload evidence to the partner portal.
- Suggested next step: assign pilot owners, schedule two pilot deployments this quarter, and collect evidence using the checklist above.
