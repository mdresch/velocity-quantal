## Summary

This Cost Management Plan provides guidance on budgeting for pilots, expense thresholds, and simple accounting practices to track costs against outcomes.

## Budget Principles

- Keep pilot costs minimal and transparent.
- Approve any spend > $500 per pilot via sponsor sign-off.
- Track hours as a notional cost to assess true ROI.

## Reporting

- Monthly cost summary per pilot and program-level burn vs. realized revenue.
