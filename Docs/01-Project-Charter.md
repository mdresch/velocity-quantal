## Executive Summary

This project creates a repeatable, scalable framework for identifying and executing business opportunities that require minimal to no initial capital investment. It focuses on leveraging time, skills, and available resources to generate initial capital which can be reinvested to scale into higher-yield opportunities. The approach emphasizes "sweat equity," adaptive planning aligned with PMBOK principles, and iterative validation to optimize for capital accumulation, skill development, and sustainable growth.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to empower individuals to leverage their time, skills, and existing resources to generate capital without upfront monetary investment. The framework will document methods for opportunity identification, feasibility assessment, execution of low-capital pilots, and reinvestment strategies that enable compounding growth. Success will be measured by predefined objectives such as the number of viable opportunities identified, pilots executed, initial capital generated, and the reinvestment of proceeds into scaling activities.

## Key Stakeholders

_TODO_: extract stakeholder list and RACI from original.
