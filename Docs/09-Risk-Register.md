## Purpose

This Risk Register captures high-level risks identified for the program, proposed mitigations, owners, and current status. It is a living document updated during pilot planning and execution.

## Risk Register (sample entries)

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Owner | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|-----------:|-------:|-------|-----------|--------|
| R1 | Low pilot adoption by target users | Medium | High | PM | Run user validation sessions; simplify onboarding | Open |
| R2 | Legal/compliance issues with pilot transactions | Low | High | Legal | Conduct legal review early; limit pilot scope | Open |
| R3 | Insufficient mentor availability | Medium | Medium | Program Lead | Build mentor pool and schedule office hours | Open |
| R4 | Data quality gaps for market signals | Medium | Medium | Market Analyst | Define minimal data schema and validation steps | Open |

## Risk Management Process

- Identify: log risks during planning and execution.
- Assess: assign likelihood and impact (Low / Medium / High).
- Mitigate: propose actions, assign owner and target date.
- Monitor: review risks at each pilot retrospective and steering meeting.

## Templates and Guidance

- Use a simple spreadsheet or the project's risk register template to track entries and history.
- For critical risks (High impact), prepare contingency plans and escalate to Sponsor.
