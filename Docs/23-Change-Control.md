## Change Control Process

1. Submit change request describing scope, impact, and rollback plan.
2. Impact assessment by PM and affected owners (cost, schedule, risk).
3. CCB review for material changes; sponsor approval for budget impacts.
4. Implement change with versioned artifacts and communication to stakeholders.

## Types of Changes

- Minor: editorial, non-scope changes — PM can approve.
- Major: scope, schedule or budget changes — CCB and Sponsor approval required.
