## Overview

Lightweight scheduling and cadence are recommended: 2–4 week pilot cycles, weekly team syncs, and milestone reviews at pilot close.

## Tools and Techniques

- Use Kanban boards for daily/weekly progress and a shared roadmap for milestones.
- Schedule buffer for dependencies and mentor availability.
