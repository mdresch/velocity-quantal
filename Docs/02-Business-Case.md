## Summary

This Business Case evaluates the opportunity to pursue "no working capital" initiatives—projects that generate initial capital through time and skill investment rather than monetary funding. The recommended approach is a structured "sweat equity" framework: identify a set of low-capital opportunities, run targeted pilots to validate feasibility, capture measurable outcomes (revenue, skill gains, or market validation), and reinvest initial proceeds into scaling opportunities.

Key benefits include: rapid capital generation without external funding, accelerated skill development for participants, flexibility to pivot based on market feedback, and a compound reinvestment path to scale successful pilots. Recommended next steps are to run 3 pilot opportunities, aim to generate an initial target capital (e.g., $1,000) within six months, and track outcomes through predefined KPIs to inform broader rollout.

## Financials

_TODO:_ insert detailed cost estimates and ROI/NPV analysis. At pilot stage, prioritize low-cost inputs (time, tools with free tiers) and capture realized revenue and effort hours to generate a simple ROI metric for each pilot.
