## Summary

This Business Case evaluates the opportunity to pursue "no working capital" initiatives—projects that generate initial capital through time and skill investment rather than monetary funding. The recommended approach is a structured "sweat equity" framework: identify a set of low-capital opportunities, run targeted pilots to validate feasibility, capture measurable outcomes (revenue, skill gains, or market validation), and reinvest initial proceeds into scaling opportunities.

Key benefits include: rapid capital generation without external funding, accelerated skill development for participants, flexibility to pivot based on market feedback, and a compound reinvestment path to scale successful pilots. Recommended next steps are to run 3 pilot opportunities, aim to generate an initial target capital (e.g., $1,000) within six months, and track outcomes through predefined KPIs to inform broader rollout.

## Financials

### Cost estimates and financial approach

For pilots, track direct spend and notional labor cost to produce a simple, comparable ROI per pilot. Use conservative estimates for revenue and capture realized outcomes after each pilot.

- Direct spend: any out-of-pocket expenses (tool subscriptions, marketing spend, domain costs).
- Notional labor cost: hours × hourly rate proxy (e.g., €25/hr) to estimate effort cost.

Simple ROI metric (pilot-level):

ROI = (Realized Revenue − Direct Spend) / (Notional Labor Cost)

Notes:
- For very early pilots, focus on gross capital generated rather than complex NPV models.
- Record assumptions (pricing, conversion) and re-run analysis after pilot completion to inform next steps.
