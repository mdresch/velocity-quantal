_TODO:_ extract scope definition, in/out-of-scope, roadmap milestones, dependencies and cost breakdown.

## Scope Overview

This document summarizes the project scope, high-level schedule, and cost guidance for the "Opportunities with No Working Capital" program. The scope focuses on identifying, piloting, and validating low-capital business opportunities and creating a repeatable framework for reinvestment and scaling.

### In-Scope

- Research and documentation of at least 10 low-capital opportunities.
- Execution of up to 3 pilot projects to validate feasibility and metrics.
- Creation of templates (feasibility, pilot plan, metrics capture) and a program dashboard.
- Collection of pilot outcomes for reinvestment decisions and lessons learned.

### Out-of-Scope

- Large capital investments and formal product development beyond validated pilots.
- Long-term operations or handoff to production teams (unless explicitly approved).

## High-Level Milestones & Schedule

- Month 0: Project setup, stakeholder alignment, and artifact templates.
- Month 1: Identify and document 10 candidate opportunities (feasibility matrix).
- Month 2–4: Run 3 prioritized pilot experiments (one pilot per 4–8 week cycle depending on complexity).
- Month 5: Aggregate results, update prioritization, decide reinvestment actions.
- Month 6+: Scale selected pilots and transition successful ones to broader programs.

Milestone dates are indicative and should be updated during Sprint/planning sessions.

## Dependencies & Constraints

- Depend on availability of pilot owners and mentors for rapid validation.
- Time is the primary resource constraint; assume contributors allocate 10–15 hours/week.
- Legal/regulatory review required for pilots with external data or paid transactions.

## Cost & Budget Guidance

This program intentionally minimizes monetary outlay during the pilot phase. Primary costs include:

- Time (internal labor) — estimate hours per pilot and track as a notional cost.
- Tooling subscriptions or third-party services (prefer free tiers during pilots).
- Minimal direct expenses (domain registration, small marketing spend) with approval thresholds.

Budget approach: treat pilot costs as low-priority capital; require explicit sponsor approval for any spend > $500 per pilot. Track realized revenue and hours to compute a simple ROI metric: (revenue − direct spend) / (hours × hourly rate proxy).

## Schedule Management

- Use lightweight planning (Kanban or 2-week sprints) for pilot execution and a shared roadmap for milestones.
- Schedule reviews at the end of each pilot cycle with a demo and retrospective to collect metrics and lessons.

## Acceptance & Exit Criteria

- A pilot is considered successful if it meets the acceptance criteria defined in its pilot plan (e.g., minimum revenue target, validated customer interest, or demonstrated skill gain).
- Exit criteria for the program phase include documented pilots, a prioritized reinvestment plan, and sponsor sign-off to proceed to scale.
